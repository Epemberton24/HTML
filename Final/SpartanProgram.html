<h2>The SPARTAN-2 PROGRAM</h2>


<p>  Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus II. 
Large for his six years of age, 
and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.
 In 2517, John and dozens of children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with clones to hide the kidnapping.
 The original children are brought to the planet Reach, one of the UNSC's bastions, to begin intense physical and psychological training to 
 become "Spartan-II" supersoldiers which was supervised by Doctor Catherine Elizabeth Halsey. 
 They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. 
 Approximately eight years later, after going through training and drills during that time in order to prepare, John and the other
 children were biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced. 
 These procedures have substantial risks which in turn kill 30 of the 75 
 conscripted children and cripple twelve others who would "wash out" of the SPARTAN-II program. Even though the program was origionally intended 
 ti quell rebellions the Spartans were force to battle an ever superios enemy known as the covenant.
 John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the Covenant, 
 a theocratic alliance of alien races, who were completely destroying the UNSC In technology and in power.In 2552, 
 the Chief and Spartans return to Reach on the UNSC Leviathan in order to initiate the UNSC's final attempt to change this war to the humans favor.
