<h2>The Fall of Reach</h2>
<p>On August 14th 2552, John and the leviathan had made it to Reach and was kept in the dark
about the covenant being on Reach while he was on stand by for further orders. The reasoning Why The
 UNSC kept him in the dark was because of their attempt to make Operation:RED FLAG a success. RED FLAG required that almost all other 
Spartan-2's like <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Noble_Team">Noble Team </a>be recalled to Reach so that once they were all gathered, they could make an attempt to 
take over a Cocenant capital ship and us it to capture one of the Covenant leaders and force a truce with the Covenant. 
However the Operation and the master Chief was forced to bored the Pillar of Autumn to escape Reach. 
When Chief entered the ship he was paired with his first artificial intelligence (AI) 
 Cortana and in a desprate attempt to escape Cortana plots a random course of escape through slipspace. 
 Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters 
 cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumn's crew.</p>
